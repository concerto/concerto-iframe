# Concerto 2 iframe Plugin
This plugin provides support to render a custom iframe, in Concerto 2.  It requires the latest version of concerto 2.

As of the EchoInchworm beta release, this plugin is included in Concerto 2 and you do _not_ need to perform the manual installation steps below.

1.  Add to your Gemfile: ```gem 'concerto_iframe'```
2.  ```bundle install```
3.  ```rails generate concerto_iframe:install install```

The last step produces a lot of output, if it runs successfully, because it recompiles the frontend js files.
